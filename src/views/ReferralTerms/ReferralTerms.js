                GMX.io provides information and resources about the fundamentals of the decentralized non-custodial

              <p className="body-text">
                The Referral Program allows you to provide a platform for advertising the GMX DApp thereby driving
                traffic to it, whereby you may earn a portion of the revenue generated (“Rebates”) if a person that is
                not you (“Trader”, “Referred User”) trades in the GMX DApp after being referred to it from an hyperlink
                (“Link”) or manually input code (“Referral Code”). The Trader will benefit from a fee discount
                (“Discount”) associated with the Referrer's tier.
              </p>
              <p className="body-text">
                After being referred to the GMX DApp from a Link, the Trader's browser will save your Referral Code and
                it will be assigned to the Trader on his first trade.
              </p>
              <p className="body-text">
                A Trader can also manually enter your Referral Code in the Traders section and change it at any time.

                Under no circumstances GMX.io shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special,

                be removed and the remainder shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.
