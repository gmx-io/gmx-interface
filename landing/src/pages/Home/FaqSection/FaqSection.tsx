                Liquidity providers receive 63% of all trading and liquidation fees. By depositing WBTC, ETH, USDC, or
                other supported assets, you can earn up to ~35% annualized yield on the largest pools.

              <p>
                GMX executes trades against a dynamically balanced liquidity pool, unlike traditional order books. This
                model supports deep liquidity, allowing for opening positions of over $50m with reduced price impact,
                even compared to the biggest order books in the space. In some cases, you may get paid when executing an
                order due to a positive price impact.
              </p>

              <p>
                GMX prevents unfair liquidations by using decentralized oracles from Chainlink and Chaos Labs, which
                aggregate prices from multiple trusted sources to avoid manipulation.
